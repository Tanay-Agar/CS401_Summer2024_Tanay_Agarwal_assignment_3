StringUtils.java - It contains a public class called StringUtils which is to be tested. It has four methods combine, reverse, upperCase, trimWhitespace. 
                  combine: It combines two string together by using two for loops.
                  reverse: It reverse a string by using a for loop.
                  upperCase: It converts a string to all uppercase letters by using the .toUpperCase() method;
                  trimWhitespace: It removes the before and after white spaces without removing the white spaces in between. It uses two while loops to achive this. 
StringUtilsTest.java - This test class does parameterized testing for 36 testcases. There are 8 test cases per method above and four testcases that use combination of methods.
